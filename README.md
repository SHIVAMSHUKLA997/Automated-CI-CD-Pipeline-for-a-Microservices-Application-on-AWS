# 🚀 Automated CI/CD Pipeline for a Web Application on AWS 🌐

## Project Overview

This project implements an automated CI/CD pipeline to deploy a Node.js web application on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service). The pipeline also incorporates FinOps principles to manage and optimize cloud costs effectively.

## Key Features

- 🛠️ **Containerized Application:** Utilizes Docker to containerize the Node.js application.
- 🔄 **Automated Deployment:** CI/CD pipeline setup using GitHub Actions for Docker build and deployment.
- ☁️ **AWS Deployment:** Deployed on AWS ECS with Fargate for scalable and efficient container management.
- 📊 **Performance Monitoring:** Integrated with CloudWatch to monitor application performance and resource utilization.
- 🔐 **Secure Access Control:** Managed access and permissions using IAM roles.
- 💰 **Cost Management:** Implemented strategies for monitoring and optimizing cloud spending.

## Steps to Setup

### Set Up the Application

1. **Initialize Node.js Project**: Set up a Node.js project with Express framework.
2. **Containerize the Application with Docker**: Create a Docker image for the Node.js application to ensure consistent deployment.

### CI/CD Pipeline Setup

1. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow**: Set up a workflow for automated Docker builds and deployments to streamline the CI/CD process.
2. **Configure Secrets**: Securely store Docker Hub credentials in GitHub repository settings to manage deployment access.

### Deploy on AWS ECS

1. **Create ECS Cluster and Task Definition**: Set up an ECS cluster and define tasks to manage the containerized application.
2. **Configure ECS Service**: Deploy the Docker image using ECS Fargate for scalable and serverless compute management.

### Monitoring and Security

1. **Integrate CloudWatch**: Use CloudWatch to monitor application performance and set up alerts for any issues.
2. **Set Up IAM Roles**: Configure IAM roles and policies to manage secure access to resources and services.

### Cost Management

1. **Cost Monitoring**: Implement cost monitoring strategies using AWS Cost Explorer and CloudWatch metrics to keep track of spending.
2. **Cost Optimization**: Utilize AWS Trusted Advisor and Cost Explorer to identify and manage underutilized resources and optimize cloud spending.
3. **Budget Alerts**: Set up budget alerts in AWS to get notified when spending approaches or exceeds predefined thresholds.
